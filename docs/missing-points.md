  🎉 RECENT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS

  ✅ **Full JWT Authentication System Completed**
  - AuthX integration with proper dependency injection
  - Complete auth endpoints: register, login, refresh, verify, logout
  - Token-based security with access and refresh tokens
  - User management with secure password hashing
  - All 40 integration tests passing (15 auth + 25 other tests)
